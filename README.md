## Description
This is a fully responsive landing page for the website "BookSummary," designed using Tailwind CSS and minimal JavaScript for mobile menu functionality.

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation**: The navigation bar is responsive and includes a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
- **Hero Section**: A welcoming hero section with a prominent call-to-action button to engage users immediately.
- **Features Section**: Highlights the key features of the website with attractive cards.
- **Testimonials Section**: Displays user testimonials to build credibility and trust.
- **Pricing Section**: Showcases the different pricing plans available.
- **FAQ Section**: Provides answers to frequently asked questions about the service, helping users quickly find the information they need.
- **Contact Section**: Allows users to get in touch through a contact form or by viewing contact details, including address, phone number, email, and business hours.
- **Footer**: Contains copyright information and is styled to match the overall design of the page.
- **Back To Top Button**: A button that allows users to quickly navigate back to the top of the page for convenience.

## Thought Process
- **Tailwind CSS**: I chose Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid and consistent styling without the need for custom CSS. It ensures the design is clean, modular, and professional.
- **Responsiveness**: The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: JavaScript is used minimally, only for the mobile menu toggle, "Back to Top" button, and statistics counter to keep the page lightweight and fast.
- **User Engagement**: The hero section with a strong call-to-action is designed to grab users' attention immediately. The features, testimonials, FAQ, and contact sections are intended to inform, build trust, and facilitate user interaction.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Using different sections and varying font sizes helps create a clear visual hierarchy, making the page easy to navigate and understand.
